Engine is smart enough to play with a normal chess player.

I have implemented famous Enpassant moves, Castelling and pawn promotion (can choose bishop, knight, queen, rook).
I have created board using 8x8 arrays and implemented this Engine using minimax algorithm and later pruned using Alpha-Beta pruning.

I chose to write this engine in python since it was more of a learning exercise than an attempt to a competitive engine. obviously it is not that much fast and smart as it is implemented in python. for efficiency it has to be wriiten in fast processing languages such as C++ and using complex bitboards. but its fun to implementing it in python.
I would like to implement an advanced Chess Engine(2.0) using more advanced topics later.
