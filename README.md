This ia an AI bases chess engine implemented in python.

Engine is smart enough to play with a normal chess player.

I have implemented famous Enpassant moves, Castelling and pawn promotion (can choose bishop, knight, queen, rook).
I have created broard using 8x8 arrays and implemented this Engine using minimax algorithm and later pruned using Alpha-Beta pruning.
